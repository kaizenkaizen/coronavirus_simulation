  <h5> This simulation doesn't attempt to calculate when the disease will peak due to a large number of people being immune. This simulation assumes people become immune after infection if they recover and survive. It doesn't account for a slowing growth rate due to a higher percentage of the population being immune. It doesn't account for multiple variations of the virus. The source code can be found at: https://gist.github.com/kaizenkaizen/91dda615315675a9f9116ecdf3f3403d . Note: I am not a professional epidemiologist and this is just a fun side project. </h5>
